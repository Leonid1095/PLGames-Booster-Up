# WinDivert Binaries

Download WinDivert 2.2 from https://reqrypt.org/windivert.html

Place the following files in this directory:
- `WinDivert.dll` — runtime library
- `WinDivert64.sys` — kernel driver
- `WinDivert.lib` — link library (for compilation)

These files are required for the WinDivert transparent interception feature on Windows.
They are NOT committed to git — download them manually or via CI.
